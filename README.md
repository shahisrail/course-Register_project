### Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project

![photo(file:///C:/Users/88017/Pictures/Screenshot_64.png)]

First, I created a Courses component and then declared a state inside it and then using the use effect I loaded the data in there and loaded the data and put my data in that state and then inside that I had all the states when needed. Either I've just passed it in that I've declared all the state in a cart component and I've passed it wherever it's needed.
